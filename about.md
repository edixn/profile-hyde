  According to the Gallup StrengthsFinder 2.0 Assessment my top 5 strengths include: 
  
1.) Communication

2.) Strategic

3.) Woo

4.) Significance

5.) Includer 

My name is Estevan Dixon, and I am a senior Journalism and Mass Communications major with a concentration in Leadership Studies. Before we get too far, yes that did say Leadership Studies. You may ask yourself how does one "study leadership", or how does one learn how to become a leader. I believe leadership is not just a unique trait that some have and others don't, but a quality that everyone has the potential of unlocking. To me, it takes one person to stand up and empower others to want to better themselves, and that is what I will bring to any organization that hires me.  

Whether it's marketing, advertising, recruiting, or sales, I have a burning passion to not only become successful, but for everyone around me to succeed as well. Growing up, I have faced the challenges of coming from a low-SES family, being a first generation college student, and being a multi-racial American. I have fought this adversity my entire life, and I have always found a way to overcome it. What was just written may be a little too personal for those simply viewing my Linkedin profile, but I must share what I have endured, because those challenges are what have developed me into the person I am today. 

When I graduate in May of 2017, I wish to be selected not based off of the various positions that I have held, but rather my abilities to lead, create, communicate, problem solve, and build relationships.
